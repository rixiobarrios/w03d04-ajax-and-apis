# Random Cat API

Now that you've worked in APIs, learn how to comb through an API's
documentation! By reading about what an API can do and how to use it, you'll be
able to add amazing features and functionality to your projects and
applications.

First, use the Cat API to display an image of a random cat every time the user
clicks a button! You will add functionality to the Random Cat button that has
been provided for you.

Next, you will add a search feature to the form in the starter code. To utilize
this API's search functionality, you will need to request and use an API key.
The key will go in a fetch object called headers. Check out the
[fetch documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
to learn more about this!

You will need to give your fetch function a second parameter called `headers`,
which will be an object that takes the key:value pair
`'x-api-key': 'INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE'`. It will look something like this:

```
fetch('www.randomURL.com', {
    headers: {
        'x-api-key': 'INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE'
    }
})
```

Adding the API key allows you to utilize all that the Cat API has to offer!
